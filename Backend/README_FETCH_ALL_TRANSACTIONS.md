# 🚀 Fetch All Cashfree Transactions

This guide shows you how to fetch ALL transaction data from Cashfree without providing specific order IDs.

## 📋 Overview

The solution works by:
1. **Storing order IDs in your database** when payments are created
2. **Fetching all order IDs** from your database 
3. **Using those IDs to get transaction details** from Cashfree
4. **Combining database info with Cashfree data** for complete information

## 🎯 Quick Start - Run Script

**Option 1: Using npm script (Recommended)**
```bash
cd Backend
npm run fetch-all-transactions
```

**Option 2: Direct node command**
```bash
cd Backend
node scripts/fetchAllTransactions.js
```

## 🌐 API Endpoint

You can also call the API endpoint:

```bash
# GET request - no parameters needed
curl http://localhost:5000/api/payment/all-transactions
```

Or visit: `http://localhost:5000/api/payment/all-transactions` in your browser

## 📊 What You'll See

The script will output:
- ✅ **Database Summary**: All payment records in your database
- 🌐 **Cashfree Summary**: Live transaction status from Cashfree
- 📋 **Plan Breakdown**: Statistics by plan type
- 💰 **Financial Summary**: Total amounts by status

## 🔧 Technical Details

### New Files Added:
- `models/Payment.js` - Database schema for storing payment records
- `scripts/fetchAllTransactions.js` - Standalone script to fetch all transactions
- Updated `cashfreeController.js` - Added `fetchAndPrintAllTransactions()` function
- Updated `cashfreeRoutes.js` - Added `/all-transactions` endpoint

### Database Schema:
```javascript
{
  orderId: String,           // Cashfree order ID
  userId: ObjectId,          // Reference to User
  orderAmount: Number,       // Payment amount
  paymentStatus: String,     // 'initiated', 'paid', 'failed', etc.
  customerDetails: Object,   // Name, email, phone
  planType: String,         // 'basic', 'standard', 'premium'
  createdAt: Date,          // Timestamp
  // ... and more fields
}
```

## 🛠️ Integration with Your Existing Code

**Important**: To make this work fully, you need to update your payment creation code to save records to the database.

The `createPaymentSession` function has been updated to automatically save payment records when creating orders. Make sure to pass the required fields:

```javascript
// When creating a payment session, include these fields:
const paymentData = {
  orderId: "order_123456",
  orderAmount: 1500,
  customerName: "John Doe",
  customerEmail: "john@example.com", 
  customerPhone: "9876543210",
  userId: "user_object_id",        // NEW: User ID from your database
  planType: "premium"              // NEW: Plan type
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"No payment records found in database"**
- Make sure you're saving payment records when creating orders
- Check that your MongoDB connection is working
- Ensure the Payment model is being used in your payment creation flow

**"No transactions found from Cashfree"**
- Check your Cashfree credentials in .env file
- Verify that the order IDs in your database are correct
- Make sure you're using the right Cashfree environment (sandbox vs production)

**Environment Variables Needed:**
```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_cashfree_app_id
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_cashfree_secret_key
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Run the script regularly** to monitor all your transactions
2. **Use the API endpoint** to integrate with dashboards or other tools
3. **Check the database vs Cashfree summaries** to spot any discrepancies
4. **Filter by date ranges** (feature can be added if needed)

## 🚀 Next Steps

If you want to add more features:
- **Date filtering**: Fetch transactions from last 7 days, month, etc.
- **User filtering**: Get transactions for specific users
- **Status updates**: Automatically sync payment status from Cashfree to database
- **Export options**: Save results to CSV or JSON files

Happy transaction monitoring! 🎉
